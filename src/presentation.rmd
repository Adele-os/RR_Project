In this project we aimed to recalculate the results of the paper [Cognitive Biases on the Iran Stock Exchange: Unsupervised Learning Approach to Examining Feature Bundles in Investors' Portfolios](http://mdpi.com/2076-3417/11/22/10916) which has been done by Adele Ossareh, Mohammad Saeed Pourjafar and Dr. Tomasz Kopczewski and published in journal of applied science. We launched a new survey and tried to compare the recent results with the original findings in the paper to identify new behavioral patterns if any.

The paper innovatively analyses the joint occurrence of cognitive biases in groups of stock exchange investors in Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE). It considers jointly a number of common fallacies, which have hitherto been studied separately. The paper aims to highlight the diverse range of investor's profiles which are characterised by such fallacies, and the considerable differences observed based on their age, gender, stock market experience and perception of market trends. The biases are as follow:

*   Confirmation bias
*   Loss aversion
*   Gambler's fallacy
*   Availability cascade
*   Hot-hand fallacy
*   Bandwagon effect
*   Dunning-Kruger effect

The reason for us to choose investgate on this project is that Iran's economy has been through a major changes ever since we published the paper and we want to examine the change from the point of investors. For this purpose of change in investors' view on TSE, one of the measure we use to distinguish the previous state of Iran's economy from today's situation (June 2022), is **CPI** which can be calculated as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
CPI=\frac{C_t}{C_0}*100
\end{aligned}
$$
in which the $CPI$ is consumer price index in current period, $C_t$ is cost of market basket in current period and $C_0$ is cost of market basket in base period. This increase in $CPI$ has also been reflected in Iran's central bank report:

The data for the paper can be found [here](https://github.com/tomvar/Cognitive_Biases_on_the_Iran_Stock_Exchange). The newly gathered data from the recent survey can be found in [this folder](https://github.com/SaeedPourjafar/RR_Project/tree/main/in). 32 investors participated in the survey through Google Forms during May 2022 in which they were the stock market holders in TSE (Tehran Stock Exchange)

Conclusion
]

.right-column[
**Hypothesis:** TSE investors' behaviors are statistically different regarding their sex, age and experience. 

**Statistical population:** All the investors of Tehran stock exchange

**Sample size:** The sample size for reproducing our research is 32 investors. (It was 104 investors in our main research.)   

**Sampling method:** Simple random sampling

**Data gathering tool:** A questionnaire which evaluates investors' behaviors in different situations.

**Year collected:** 2022 (The main research was conducted in early 2021)

**Statistical methods:** Bootstrapping, Mood's median test, post-hoc tests

.right-column[

The results of Mood's median tests for comparing behavior of males and females for different fallacies is presented in table 1. Regarding these results, it seems that men and women are significantly different in Dunning-Kruger Fallacy which was not significant in our main research. In that research, Gambler's and availability fallacies were significant, though.

**Conclusion**
]

.right-column[
Originally we observed that out of this various test based on fallacies, there were 9 tests in which the results differ based on either sex, age and experience. In general we don't observe gambler's, availability and confirmation bias in the newly gathered data. However on the other hand we could see that Dunning-Kruger and loss aversion is still significant.The lack of significant differences from the past cn be related to the stock market bubble that burst and the current economic situation in which the CPI is dramatically increasing and inflation rate records high as the investors become reluctant to invest in TSE and thus the result of the survey and the corresponding test roughly show that no matter in which age, experience level or gender the respondents are, they generally share the same view regarding investing in stock market.
